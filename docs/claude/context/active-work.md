## Active Tasks

### 1. Manual Claude Code Integration Testing

**Status**: ‚è≥ In Progress
**Priority**: High
**Owner**: Development Team
**Due**: 2025-10-10

**Description**:
Validate the GA4 Admin MCP Server works correctly when integrated with Claude Code using real GA4 credentials.

**Test Scenarios** (from CLAUDE_CODE_INTEGRATION.md):
1. ‚úÖ List custom dimensions - Verify server responds correctly
2. ‚úÖ Create custom dimension - Test with real property
3. ‚úÖ Create conversion event - Test marking events as conversions
4. ‚úÖ List conversion events - Verify all events are listed
5. ‚ùå Error handling - Invalid property ID
6. ‚ùå Error handling - Duplicate dimension
7. ü§ñ Natural language interaction - Full Claude integration
8. üì¶ Batch operations - Multiple commands in sequence

**Blockers**:
- Need service account credentials set up
- Need test GA4 property with Editor permissions

**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Set up service account in GCP
- [ ] Grant service account Editor role in test GA4 property
- [ ] Configure Claude Code settings.json
- [ ] Run through all 8 test scenarios
- [ ] Document results in TEST_RESULTS.md
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION.md with findings

## Blocked Items

### No Current Blockers

**Previous Blockers** (Resolved):
- ‚úÖ TypeScript build errors - Fixed 2025-10-08
- ‚úÖ Unit test failures - Fixed 2025-10-08
- ‚úÖ Missing documentation - Completed 2025-10-08

---

## Technical Debt

### High Priority

**1. Code Coverage: 0%**
- **Issue**: Tests mock googleapis but don't test MCP server
- **Impact**: No confidence in server request handlers
- **Effort**: 2-3 days
- **Plan**: Refactor tests to instantiate server and test handlers

**2. Input Validation Not Enforced**
- **Issue**: Validation logic exists but not in server
- **Impact**: Invalid inputs could cause API errors
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Plan**: Add validation layer before API calls

### Medium Priority

**3. Error Messages Generic**
- **Issue**: Basic error messages, not user-friendly
- **Impact**: Poor user experience when things fail
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Plan**: Add error classification and helpful messages

**4. No Retry Logic**
- **Issue**: Transient failures cause immediate failure
- **Impact**: Reliability issues with temporary API problems
- **Effort**: 1-2 days
- **Plan**: Add exponential backoff for 5xx errors

### Low Priority

**5. No Structured Logging**
- **Issue**: Only console.error for logging
- **Impact**: Hard to debug production issues
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Plan**: Add structured logging with levels

**6. No Metrics Collection**
- **Issue**: No visibility into performance
- **Impact**: Can't measure or optimize
- **Effort**: 1 day
- **Plan**: Add response time tracking

## Decisions Made

### 2025-10-08

**Decision**: Use two-tier documentation system (CLAUDE.md + docs/)
- **Rationale**: Learned from coaching_transcript_tool success
- **Impact**: Better organization, easier navigation
- **Alternative Considered**: Single README.md (too long, hard to maintain)

**Decision**: Create docs/claude/ for Claude-specific docs
- **Rationale**: Separate Claude Code docs from user docs
- **Impact**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Alternative Considered**: Everything in root docs/ (less organized)

### 2025-10-07

**Decision**: Use Jest for testing (not Mocha or Vitest)
- **Rationale**: De facto standard, great TypeScript support
- **Impact**: Familiar to most developers
- **Alternative Considered**: Vitest (newer, faster, but less mature)

**Decision**: Target 80% code coverage
- **Rationale**: Industry standard for quality code
- **Impact**: Need comprehensive tests
- **Alternative Considered**: 100% (too strict), 50% (too lax)

**Decision**: Use service account auth (not OAuth)
- **Rationale**: Better for automation, no user interaction
- **Impact**: Need to manage keys securely
- **Alternative Considered**: OAuth (requires user login)

## Questions & Answers

### Q: Why is code coverage 0% if tests pass?

**A**: The unit tests mock the googleapis API and test the mock behavior, but they don't actually test the MCP server request handlers in src/index.ts. The coverage tool correctly shows that our source code isn't being executed during tests. We need to refactor tests to instantiate the MCP server and test the actual request handlers.

### Q: Should we target 100% code coverage?

**A**: No. 80% is a good balance between quality and practicality. Some code (like error handling for extremely rare cases) isn't worth testing to 100%. Focus on testing the happy paths, common error cases, and critical edge cases.

### Q: When should we open source this?

**A**: After Phase 2 is complete and we've used it in production for at least a month. We want to ensure it's stable, well-documented, and has no embarrassing bugs before sharing with the community.

### Q: Can we add support for other analytics platforms?

**A**: Maybe in the future, but let's focus on GA4 first. Once we have a solid foundation and community adoption, we can consider expanding to other platforms like Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.

## Notes

### Lessons Learned

**From Phase 1**:
- ‚úÖ TDD really does save time (caught issues early)
- ‚úÖ Good documentation is worth the investment
- ‚úÖ Studying similar projects helps (coaching_transcript_tool)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Should have tested MCP handlers from start (refactor needed)

**For Phase 2**:
- üìù Write tests that test actual code, not mocks
- üìù Start with input validation, not add later
- üìù Document as you go, not at the end
- üìù Get feedback early, don't wait for perfection
