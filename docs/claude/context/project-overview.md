# Project Overview

**Purpose**: High-level project context for Claude Code
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08

---

## Project Summary

**Name**: GA4 Admin MCP Server
**Type**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server
**Purpose**: Automate Google Analytics 4 property configuration through natural language
**Version**: 0.1.0
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Manual Testing

---

## The Problem

### Manual GA4 Configuration is Painful

**Current Manual Process** (15+ minutes):
1. Log into GA4 Console
2. Navigate through Admin UI
3. Create custom dimensions one by one
4. Mark conversion events one by one
5. Manually verify each setting
6. Repeat for staging/production environments
7. Document changes in tickets
8. Easy to miss steps or make errors

**Pain Points**:
- ⏰ Time-consuming (15-30 minutes per environment)
- 🐛 Error-prone (easy to misconfigure)
- 📝 Hard to document (manual screenshots)
- 🔁 Not repeatable (each time is manual)
- 👥 Team sync issues (different environments, different configs)
- 🔍 Difficult to audit (what changed when?)

### Why Existing Solutions Don't Work

**Option 1: Manual Setup**
- ❌ Too slow (15+ minutes)
- ❌ Error-prone
- ❌ Not repeatable
- ❌ Hard to sync across environments

**Option 2: Python Scripts**
- ⚠️ Faster (2 minutes)
- ✅ Repeatable
- ❌ Requires separate setup
- ❌ Not integrated with workflow
- ❌ Command-line only

**Option 3: Official GA MCP Server**
- ✅ Claude Code integrated
- ❌ Read-only (no configuration writes)
- ❌ Can't create dimensions or mark conversions
- ❌ Doesn't solve the problem

**Option 4: Terraform**
- ❌ GA4 provider has limited support
- ❌ Doesn't support custom dimensions
- ❌ Doesn't support conversion events
- ❌ Not feasible for this use case

## Our Solution

### GA4 Admin MCP Server

**What It Does**:
- ✅ **30-second setup** vs 15-minute manual process
- ✅ **Natural language interface** via Claude Code
- ✅ **Fully automated** custom dimension creation
- ✅ **Automated conversion event** marking
- ✅ **Completely repeatable** across environments
- ✅ **Integrated** with developer workflow

**How It Works**:
```
Developer: "Create custom dimension for tracking signup method in GA4"
   ↓ (Natural Language)
Claude Code
   ↓ (MCP Protocol)
GA4 Admin MCP Server
   ↓ (Admin API)
Google Analytics 4
   ↓
✅ Dimension created, immediately available in GA4 UI
```

**Key Value Propositions**:
1. **Speed**: 30 seconds vs 15 minutes (30x faster)
2. **Accuracy**: Zero configuration errors
3. **Repeatability**: Same command, same result every time
4. **Integration**: Works where you already work (Claude Code)
5. **Documentation**: Commands are self-documenting
6. **Team Sync**: Share commands, everyone gets same config

## Technical Context

### Technology Choices

**Runtime: Node.js 18+**
- ✅ Required by MCP SDK
- ✅ Excellent async/await support
- ✅ Rich ecosystem (googleapis)
- ✅ Cross-platform

**Language: TypeScript 5+**
- ✅ Type safety
- ✅ Better developer experience
- ✅ Compile-time error checking
- ✅ Great IDE support

**Framework: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk**
- ✅ Official MCP implementation
- ✅ Handles protocol complexity
- ✅ Well-documented
- ✅ Active development

**API Client: googleapis**
- ✅ Official Google library
- ✅ Comprehensive API coverage
- ✅ Auto-generated from API specs
- ✅ Regular updates

**Testing: Jest**
- ✅ De facto standard for Node.js
- ✅ Great TypeScript support
- ✅ Built-in coverage
- ✅ Fast and reliable

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision: Stateless Server**
- Why: Simpler, safer, easier to test
- Trade-off: Can't cache across requests (future optimization)

**Decision: stdio Transport**
- Why: Required by MCP protocol
- Trade-off: No HTTP endpoints (not needed for MCP)

**Decision: Service Account Auth**
- Why: Automated, no user interaction needed
- Trade-off: Need to manage keys securely

**Decision: No Database**
- Why: Stateless, GA4 is source of truth
- Trade-off: Can't offline/cache (future optimization)
